#AfterShip V2 API

####Overview

The AfterShip API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). Each resource, like Tracking, Courier, has its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, weâ€™ve tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.

All API usage happens through AfterShip applications, created by either website owners for their own sites, or by AfterShip developer for use by website owners.


Developers create applications through their account page.
